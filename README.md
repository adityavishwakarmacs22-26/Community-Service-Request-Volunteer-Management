# GreenCity: Community Service Request & Volunteer Management

![GreenCity Logo](assets/greencity-logo.png)  
*Connecting citizens, city staff, and volunteers for a cleaner, safer community.*

---

## **Project Overview**

**GreenCity** is a Salesforce-based CRM solution that empowers residents to report local service issues (such as potholes, broken streetlights, or illegal dumping), enables city staff to track and resolve these requests efficiently, and allows volunteers to sign up for community improvement activities and events.

This project is designed for the **TCS Salesforce Last Mile Program** and demonstrates end-to-end Salesforce platform capabilities, from requirement analysis to deployment and reporting.

## **Key Features**

- **Citizen Service Portal:** Residents submit, track, and get updates on service requests.
- **Volunteer Management:** Volunteers register for cleanup events, track participation, and receive acknowledgments.
- **Case Assignment & Routing:** Automated workflows assign cases to the appropriate city department for resolution.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Automated emails and in-app alerts keep everyone informed.
- **Dashboards & Reporting:** City managers monitor key metrics—resolution time, request volume, volunteer hours, and more.
- **Role-based Access:** Secure access for residents, volunteers, city staff, and administrators.
