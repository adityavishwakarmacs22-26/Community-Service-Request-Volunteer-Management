# GreenCity: Community Service Request & Volunteer Management

*Connecting citizens, city staff, and volunteers for a cleaner, safer community.*

---

## **Project Overview**

**GreenCity** is a Salesforce-based CRM solution that empowers residents to report local service issues (such as potholes, broken streetlights, or illegal dumping), enables city staff to track and resolve these requests efficiently, and allows volunteers to sign up for community improvement activities and events.

This project is designed for the **TCS Salesforce Last Mile Program** and demonstrates end-to-end Salesforce platform capabilities, from requirement analysis to deployment and reporting.
